Limit/Age! Under 18 years old? or not..! Please do not talk or act strangely/offensively. I will feel uncomfortable and nauseous if you do that  

C+H is comfortable, but if I write dniuf or dniuc I WILL LEAVE IT 

I'm always afk so please whisper when talking, I will NOT RESPOND if you message publicly

You will always find me in the Bsd or GI-HSR area and the area outside the bakery with three trees growing close together next to the Safe server area. Or at the Bllk area and on both sides of the road from the lobby to the Vietnamese server area

My online gaming hours are not fixed but you will definitely see me in the evening or during the day if I have a day off

SPECIAL: I am not good at English or other languages ​​except my mother tongue. So that's why I'm going to take a moment to answer your question
I HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY. I'M VERY SORRY IF I DON'T REPLY OR Ignore you because I'm busy, so please wait a little longer
